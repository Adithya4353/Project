# ðŸ§ ðŸ“· Object Detection + Text Generation Pipeline

This project integrates computer vision and natural language generation. It detects objects in an image using a pre-trained Faster R-CNN model and generates a descriptive or creative sentence based on the detected objects using GPT-2 (`gpt2-medium`).

---

 What This Project Does

1. Loads an image provided by the user.
2. Detects objects in the image using `Faster R-CNN` trained on the COCO dataset.
3. Generates a description** using the `GPT-2` language model, based on the detected objects and a user-provided prompt.

This makes it useful for:
- Smart captioning systems
- AI-assisted scene analysis
- Creative writing based on images
- Multimodal applications

 How It Works â€“ Detailed Breakdown
 
This project integrates two major AI capabilities:

Computer Vision â€“ To detect objects in an image.

Natural Language Generation â€“ To generate descriptive or creative text based on the visual content.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step overview of what happens when you run the script:

ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Input Handling
Image path and user prompt are passed as arguments (--image and --prompt).

The script first validates the image:

Checks if the file exists.

Verifies it is a valid image (JPG, PNG, etc.) using the PIL library.


ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Load Image
The image is opened using PIL.Image and converted to RGB format to ensure compatibility with PyTorch models.


ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Load Object Detection Model
The script loads a pre-trained Faster R-CNN model (fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn) from torchvision.models.detection.

This model is trained on the COCO dataset, which contains 91 object categories.


ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Object Detection
The image is transformed into a tensor using transforms.ToTensor().

The tensor is passed through the model in inference mode (no gradients).

Output contains:

labels: Detected object category indices.

scores: Confidence scores for each object.

ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Load the Language Model
A Hugging Face text generation pipeline is loaded using the gpt2-medium model.

If the model fails to load (due to memory or connection issues), it is handled gracefully.


ðŸ”¹ Step 6: Compose Prompt for LLM
"
ðŸ”¹ Step 7: Text Generation
The full prompt is passed to the LLM.

gpt2-medium generates up to 100 tokens of continuation based on the input.


ðŸ”¹ Step 8: Output
